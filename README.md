VegRuCorpus: A Dataset for Russian Vegetarianism Opinion Classification
VegRuCorpus is a manually annotated dataset of Russian-language social media texts expressing opinions on vegetarianism. This dataset addresses the underexplored area of dietary discourse in Russian-speaking contexts, capturing public attitudes toward vegetarianism through nuanced annotations.

The corpus distinguishes between pro-vegetarian and anti-vegetarian opinions, providing a valuable resource for natural language processing (NLP) tasks in opinion mining and classification. VegRuCorpus has been evaluated using state-of-the-art transformer-based models, including ruBERT and ruRoBERTa, showcasing the potential of advanced NLP techniques in Russian text classification.

By bridging the gap in Russian-language dietary opinion mining, VegRuCorpus supports research in public health, ethical discourse, and environmental sustainability, while advancing NLP methodologies for underrepresented languages.

This dataset consists of 1,024 handpicked articles.
Data were gathered by accessing articles from the Russian platform dzen.ru
